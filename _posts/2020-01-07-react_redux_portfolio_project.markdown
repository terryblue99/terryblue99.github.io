My goal for [this project](https://github.com/terryblue99/my-watch-collection-v-002) was to expand upon my [previous Rails Project](https://github.com/terryblue99/my-watch-collection-v-001) by utilizing a React Redux frontend and a Rails API backend. 

It is an application named 'My Watch Collection' that allows a watch collector (like myself) to catalogue, update, and view their watch collection.

**REQUIREMENTS**
 
1.  The code should be written in ES6 as much as possible
2.  Use the create-react-app generator to start the project
3.  The app should have one HTML page to render the react-redux application
4.  There should be 2 container components
5.  There should be 5 stateless components
6.  There should be 3 routes
7.  The Application must make use of react-router and proper RESTful routing
8.  Use Redux middleware to respond to and modify state change
9.  Make use of async actions to send data to and receive data from a server
10.  The Rails API should handle the data persistence. Use fetch() within actions to GET and POST data from the API - do not use jQuery methods
11.  The client-side application should handle the display of data with minimal data manipulation
12.  The application should have some minimal styling: like react-bootstrap, but additional CSS may be included
      
I used Github branches to code and test my application as I developed it and merged those with the master branch when successfully tested.
