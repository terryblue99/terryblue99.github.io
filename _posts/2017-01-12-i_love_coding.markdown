I have been a Mainframe developer for most of my working life but diverged from that over the past several years to become more involved in the Systems/Business Analysis side; mainly because that was where the greater need existed in the consultancy firm I worked for. I am currently unemployed, initially due to lack of work, but now more so because I'm seeking to return to my first love of coding, specifically as a fullstack web developer.

I have many years of involvement in the IT industry as a COBOL programmer and Systems/Business Analyst, using JCL, DB2, SQL and other mainframe related software as needed. As such I have developed the ability to adapt and quickly learn different technologies. 

I am very passionate about delivering excellence in my work that usually goes beyond expectations and I am really excited about moving to the next stage of my coding journey :)
